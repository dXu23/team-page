<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](team-page.jpg)

- Where can I see your demo?

Right [here](https://coldfix.dev/dev-challenges/team-page.html)

- What was your experience?

I had a difficult time trying to make Flexbox work for the overall layout
of the webpage, so I ended up having to use CSS Grid. I thought I could get
away with using 'flex-wrap: row' to automatically wrap the images of people.
However, the photos offset from the top would vary depending on the screen
size/number of elements in a row.

- What have you learned/improved?

I improved my knowledge of CSS Grid and Flexbox.

- Your wisdom? :)

Wait for the [nth-col](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-col)
feature to appear before attempting a project like this again.
